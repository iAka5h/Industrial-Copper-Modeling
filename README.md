## Overview

Welcome to the **Industrial Copper Modeling** project! This project focuses on predicting copper prices and classifying transaction statuses (Won or Lost) using machine learning. These insights aim to support pricing strategy and decision-making in the industrial copper market. The project is built using Python and features interactive visualizations to explore model predictions and transaction trends.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze key metrics for copper transactions, price trends, and success rates.
- **Price Prediction**: Machine learning models predict the optimal selling price of copper based on historical data.
- **Transaction Classification**: Classifies transactions as 'Won' or 'Lost' to understand success factors.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize insights with Streamlit for an interactive data exploration experience.
- **Actionable Insights**: Discover trends that can assist stakeholders in making data-driven business decisions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server (optional for storing data)
- Streamlit

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Industrial-Copper-Modeling
    cd Industrial-Copper-Modeling
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Set up a MySQL database to store and query transaction data. Update the connection details in `config.py` or the relevant configuration file.

### Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Explore copper transaction data, visualize trends, and make predictions using the interactive dashboard.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Transaction data on copper pricing and statuses is collected and stored.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Raw data is cleaned, processed, and formatted for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key metrics are explored to uncover pricing and success trends.
4. **Modeling**: Machine learning models are applied for tasks like price prediction and transaction classification.
5. **Visualization**: Key insights are displayed on an interactive dashboard with Streamlit.
